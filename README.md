# RoPlanner
This repository contains the source code for RoPlanner, a small project made by me. This project is being made in QT Creator w/ C++
#
RoPlanner is an open-source application where you can add todo lists and when you are done with those, you can mark those as completed.
# Notices
This app is intented to be small - nothing big, but small. This app may receive future updates from time to time but expect the features to be small. Otherwise, it may not because features-wise, may be complete and due to how I wanted to be.
