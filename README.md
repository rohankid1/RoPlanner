# RoPlanner
This repository contains the source code for RoPlanner, a small project made by me. This project is being made in QT Creator w/ C++
#
RoPlanner is an open-source application where you can add todo lists and when you are done with those, you can mark those as completed. Or you can undo them.
# Notices
This application is still in WIP (work in progress) and many features have yet to come such as data saving using SQLite (which is a small database used to save data locally to your device). Everything seen below may be subject to change and the design is not final.
